Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1

Both public and private subnet network ACL rules allow all traffic on all ports from all ports.

Network ACL rules should be used to minimise the available network connectivity to reduce the traffic that can be 
sent to and from the subnet. This will reduce the ability for malicious actions that could be 
performed against the infrastructure by an attacker, and will keep the private subnet (and contents) private.

# Poor practice 2

S3 buckets, including the bucket for VPC flow logs, have no server-side encryption enabled / files 
were uploaded without encryption and all the buckets have block public access disabled.

Not encrypting the contents of the s3 buckets could allow unauthorized access to the 
content to view the content within the buckets. The vpc-flow-logs may contain compromising 
information that could directly or indirectly cause further security compromises if the rest of the infrastructure 
is not set up correctly.

# Poor practice 3
The s3 buckets do not follow the principle of least privilege

By default, all S3 buckets are private and can be accessed only by users that are explicitly granted access. 
When using AWS, it's a best practice to restrict access to your resources to the people that absolutely need it. 
Follow the principle of least privilege.
Restrict access to your S3 buckets or objects by:
1. Writing AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user policies
2. Writing bucket policies that define access to specific buckets and objects. 
3. Using Amazon S3 Block Public Access as a centralized way to limit public access. 
4. Setting access control lists (ACLs) on your buckets and objects.
